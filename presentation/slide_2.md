# Why Gradle

*	Takes good parts from both Ant and Maven  
	It has **flexibility** of Ant but follows Maven **life-cycle**
*	Follows **build by convention** philosophy
*	Has its own **DSL based on Groovy**
*	Build scripts are essentially **code** written in a **descriptive** instead of **procedural** manner using Groovy language features 
*	Does it's own **dependency resolution**
*	Infinitely expendable by usage o **plug-ins**
