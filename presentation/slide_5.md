# Basic commands

Without **plug-ins** gradle defines just basic commands

*	**init** - Initializes a new Gradle build.
*	**wrapper** - Generates Gradle wrapper files.  
*	**projects** - Displays the sub-projects of root project.
*	**properties** - Displays the properties of root project.
*	**tasks** - Displays the tasks runnable from root project.

All commands above have additional command options.  
There is even a soon to be deprecated GUI which can be accesses by **_gradle --gui_**
